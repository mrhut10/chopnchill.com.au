Here is a list of the software I use to [Get Things Done™](https://gettingthingsdone.com)

Inspired by [this post from Wes Bos](wesbos.com/uses).

## Code editor: Visual Studio Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is my favorite text editor.

I can't belive how much I love this application considering it is made by Microsoft!

It is extremely customisable — [you can see my settings here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lukebennett88/9141bc2881906fca00bfa39029bd5c03/raw/09adabbd078ceab7ce2128ccfde95a7d52f0c9de/settings.json).

If only it wasn't an [Electron app](https://electronjs.org) it would be perfect.

I'm keeping an eye out for Coda Next though, as I'm a huge fan of everything that [Panic](https://panic.com) do.

## Terminal: iTerm 2

Most of the time, I'm happy using the terminal that is build into VS Code, but when I do reach for a dedicated terminal, my favourite is [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com).

It is a native Mac app, that has been around for years, and is actively maintained.

I don't ask a lot from a terminal client, so my favourite features of iTerm 2 are small: being able to `⌘+Click` on a link to open it in the browser, and being able to map a universal shortcut to bring the terminal to the front from anywhere (I have this mapped to `⌘+Esc`.)

## Terminal Shell: Fish

I spent ages trying to learn about Zsh, and frameworks for managing Zsh plugins such as [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh), [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) and [Antibody](https://getantibody.github.io/), but in the end there was just too much configuration involved.

Fish does 99% of what I want it to do out of the box.

## Shell package manager: Fisher

[Fisher is great](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher), it's fast, easy to use, and works with more popular packages, such as [Oh My Fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish).

## Other

[I have a dotfiles repository](https://github.com/lukebennett88/dotfiles) set up with all my configuration settings. This make setting up a new computer a breeze, and I have some peace of mind that everything is backed up.

## Mac Apps

Here is an alphabetical list of some of my favourite Mac software.

- **[Affinity Designer:](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/)** Powerful vector image editor. Much cheaper and faster than Adobe Illustrator, and does most of the stuff it needs to. I need to spend more time learning it though.
- **[Alfred:](https://www.alfredapp.com)** I feel like I've got handcuffs on if I try to use a computer without Alfred. Invaluable.
- **[Backblaze:](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/0176ll)** Cloud backup, extremely cheap ($5 USD per month, or$50 USD for a year.) Takes a few days for the first backup to complete, but it's incremental after that. Haven't _needed_ to use it yet, but well worth the money for peace of mind. This link is a referral code, so I get 3 months free for each person who signs up.
- **[Figma:](https://www.figma.com)** Alternative to [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com), but has a free tier if you don't require the collaboration features. Another app that I need to spend more time learning.
- **[Hazel:](https://www.noodlesoft.com)** I had this running on a previous computer, and it was great, but takes a lot of fiddling to get everything working just the way I like it. I'll get around to setting it up again. One day.
- **[Pixelmator:](https://www.pixelmator.com/)** Does all the basics that I require from an image editor.
- **[Sip:](https://sipapp.io)** Great little menubar app for grabbing colours and keeping track of them for you.
- **[Things 3:](https://culturedcode.com/things/)** My favourite task manager.
- **[Toothfairy:](https://c-command.com/toothfairy/)** Handy menubar app for pairing AirPods (or other bluetooth devices) easily.
